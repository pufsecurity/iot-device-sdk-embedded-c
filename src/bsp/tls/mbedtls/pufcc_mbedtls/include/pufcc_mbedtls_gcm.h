/**
 * \brief           This function performs GCM encryption or decryption of a buffer.
 *
 * \note            For encryption, the output buffer can be the same as the

 *                  the same as input buffer. If the buffers overlap, the output
 *                  buffer must trail at least 8 Bytes behind the input buffer.
 *
 * \warning         When this function performs a decryption, it outputs the
 *                  authentication tag and does not verify that the data is
 *                  authentic. You should use this function to perform encryption
 *                  only. For decryption, use mbedtls_gcm_auth_decrypt() instead.
 *
 * \param ctx       The GCM context to use for encryption or decryption.
 * \param mode      The operation to perform:
 *                  - #MBEDTLS_GCM_ENCRYPT to perform authenticated encryption.
 *                    The ciphertext is written to \p output and the
 *                    authentication tag is written to \p tag.
 *                  - #MBEDTLS_GCM_DECRYPT to perform decryption.
 *                    The plaintext is written to \p output and the
 *                    authentication tag is written to \p tag.
 *                    Note that this mode is not recommended, because it does
 *                    not verify the authenticity of the data. For this reason,
 *                    you should use mbedtls_gcm_auth_decrypt() instead of
 *                    calling this function in decryption mode.
 * \param length    The length of the input data, which is equal to the length
 *                  of the output data.
 * \param iv        The initialization vector.
 * \param iv_len    The length of the IV.
 * \param add       The buffer holding the additional data.
 * \param add_len   The length of the additional data.
 * \param input     The buffer holding the input data. Its size is \b length.
 * \param output    The buffer for holding the output data. It must have room
 *                  for \b length bytes.
 * \param tag_len   The length of the tag to generate.
 * \param tag       The buffer for holding the tag.
 *
 * \return          \c 0 if the encryption or decryption was performed
 *                  successfully. Note that in #MBEDTLS_GCM_DECRYPT mode,
 *                  this does not indicate that the data is authentic.
 * \return          #MBEDTLS_ERR_GCM_BAD_INPUT if the lengths are not valid.
 * \return          #MBEDTLS_ERR_GCM_HW_ACCEL_FAILED or a cipher-specific
